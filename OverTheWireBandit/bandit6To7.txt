Log into bandit 6 using the 7th password, there is nothing in this file
We have to find a file on the server which is of size 33 bytes
is owned by bandit7 and owned by the group bandit6
=>find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6
output->A long list having many lines saying permission denied warnings

/ is used to tell that the file is to be found all around the server not 
onlyt in the current directory

we have to suppress this warnings to get our result
=>find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
output->/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
the 2>/dev/null command redirects all the warnings to dev/null
effectively suppressing the warnings

save the path and use cd 
=>cd /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Or
use the command
=>cd -- "$(dirname "$(find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null)")"
in this command dirname extracts the directory part of the path and this value is fed into cd

check if the file is there or not
=>find bandit7.password
output->bandit7.password

see the contents of the file
=>cat bandit7.password
output-> 8th password
save the 8th password
