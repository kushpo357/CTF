log into bandit 7 using 8th password

check the contents
=>ls
output->data.txt

check the file type
=>file data.txt
output->data.txt: Unicode text, UTF-8 text

check the amount of lines in the file
=>wc -l data.txt
output->98567 data.txt

since the amount of lines is too much we will have to use grep
we have to get a line which is next to the word "millionth"
=>grep "millionth" data.txt
output->millionth       9th password

save the 9th password
